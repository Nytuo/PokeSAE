You have finished your mission, saved the world, rescued the Professor Raoult who have fall asleep during the fight.
You deliver him and return to his office.

But at the same moment, a band of four students, block the only way out.
It's look like they want to fight you... But why?

The first one Elyan GRELOT, says:
" Why did you kill them?
  The confinement was good, we had courses at distance, no controls, and especially we could play all day long"

The others agreed to what he said.

He approaches and launch a poke-ball, he wants to fight you. But if you defeat it you will have all the bands on you...

Elyan GRELOT wants to fight you!
