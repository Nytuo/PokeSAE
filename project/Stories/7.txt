You have finished your mission, saved the world, rescued the Professor Raoult who have fallen asleep during the fight.
You deliver him and return to his office.

But at the same moment, a band of four students, block the only way out.
It's look like they want to fight you... But why?

The first one Elyan GRELOT, says:
" Why did you kill them?
  The lockdown was good, we had distance learning courses, no exams, and especially we could play all day long"

The others agreed to what he said.

He approaches and launches a pok√©ball, he wants to fight you. But if you defeat him you will have the whole band against you...

Elyan GRELOT wants to fight you!
