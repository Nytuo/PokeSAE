Before being taken to jail,he gives you the position of Covid-19 XD
He is where all begin... At MARSEILLE!

You are now back to your hometown.
And you start looking for the last variant of Covid-19.

As you were taking rest in a bar, a strange man approach you and give you a piece of paper.
On it a message : "I have your Professor Raoult as a hostage. If you want him back come alone at these coordinates : 43.292240468038706, 5.359117333937427"

You type the coordinates on Google Maps and reach the location.

Once there you see multiple signs to guide you.
You reach the Professor but obviously that was a trap and Covid-19 XD is there.

- I wasn't expecting you to come for such an old, mad Professor. You have defeated all my brothers, didn't you?
  I am aware that your Pokemons use Chloroquine in order to defeat us.
  But guess what mine use a toxic substance for humans...Dimethylcadmium.
  I hope you are ready to die.


Covid-19 XD wants to battle!
